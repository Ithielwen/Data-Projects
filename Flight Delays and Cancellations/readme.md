# Project Overview
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the dataset.
Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles and effective communication.

# Flight Delays and Cancellations
