## Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Data Analyst Certificate - Project I

### Overview
In this project, we will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago,
New York City, and Washington. Using Python, a script will be written to import the data and answer questions about it by 
computing descriptive statistics. The script will also take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the 
terminal to present these statistics.

### What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, we'll require the following softwares:
1. Python
2. A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
3. A terminal application

### The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the United States, contains randomly selected data for
the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:
1. Start Time
2. End Time
3. Trip Duration
4. Start Station
5. End Station
6. User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
1. Gender
2. Birth Year

### Answering Questions
Through the script, we'll be able to answer the following questions:
1. What month occurs most often in the start time?
2. What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?
3. What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
4. What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
5. What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
6. What is the most common trip (i.e. the combination of the start station and end station that occurs most often)?
7. What are the counts of each user type?
8. What are the counts of each gender?
9. What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?

### The Interactive Experience
For a more interactive experience, the script takes raw input in the terminal to present the statistics.
