# Prosper Loans Exploration
## by Emma Hungrige

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I was interested in using Prosper Loan Data to better understand : </br>

- Univariate Exploration:
  - Loan status
  - Employment Status
  - Stated Monthly Income
- Bivariate Exploration:
  - Status and Prosper Rating
  - Credit Start with Listing Category
  - Loan Status and Loan Amount
  - Prosper Rating and Employment Status
- Multivariate Exploration:
  - Rating, Loan Amount and Loan Status
  - Credit category, Credit rating and outcome of Credit
  - Amount, Listing Category Loan and Loan Status Interact
  
### Project Overview <a name="po"></a>

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.


### Project Details <a name="pd"></a>

This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of your choosing. You will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships, but it does not need to be clean or perfect. There is no one single answer that needs to come out of a given dataset. This part of the project is your opportunity to ask questions of the data and make your own discoveries. It’s important to keep in mind that sometimes exploration can lead to dead ends, and that it can take multiple steps to dig down to what you’re truly looking for.

In the second part, you will take your main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, you will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate your results. This part of the project should make heavy use of the first part of the project. 


### Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>

The data set chosen for this project contains information on peer to peer loans facilitated by credit company Prosper. There are 113,937 loans with 81 variables. For the purpose of this investigation I've taken the following variables: Term, LoanStatus, BorrowerRate, ProsperRating (Alpha), ListingCategory (numeric), EmploymentStatus, DelinquenciesLast7Years, StatedMonthlyIncome, TotalProsperLoans, LoanOriginalAmount, LoanOriginationDate, Recommendations and Investors.


## Key Insights for Presentation <a name="kip"></a>

Key plots were chosen with high data-to-ink ratio for this presentation. The plots presented shows the distribution of the main variables - LoanStatus, StatedMonthlyIncome, and ProsperRating (Alpha). These factors help to show some of the major predictors for LoanStatus and ProsperRating variables.
