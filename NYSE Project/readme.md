# Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze real life data fron the New York Stock exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. In this project, you will go through the process of calculating
summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies.
The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.
